![walmart-logo-banner-2mt5sis7wghasqjs](https://github.com/nicduffee/project-4/assets/91498217/d3669dbf-7fde-4b4a-af03-a2bca05f3b92)



## Overview
Retail Stores regularly deal with unforeseen demands and experience stock shortages due to higher than predicted sales. These stores require an effective method to ensure they are prepared.</br>

The aim of this project is to examine Walmart store sales data from 45 stores over the time period: 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01 and utilize our experience in machine learning to develop a model that can help predict future sales numbers.</br>

### Questions
Using the following questions as a guide, this project will also explore the factors that might lead to higher sales.
 
1. How do the different stores' weekly sales compare?
    - Which store has the highest weekly sales across the time period?
    - What is the average sales across all the stores?

2. How do the holiday periods affect sales?
    - Extra focus to be added to halloween as the next holiday in our current calendar

3. What effect does the local fuel prices have on sales numbers?

4. What effect does the local temperature have on sales numbers?

5. Does the local Unemployment percentage have a postive or negative effects on sales?

### 1. Sourcing the Data
- The Wallmart Sales dataset used in this project can be downloaded from: </br>
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rutuspatel/walmart-dataset-retail

### 2. Data Cleaning
- The dataset is imported and cleaned using the Pandas library, ready for exploration.

### 3. Exploring the Data
- The Dataset is loaded into a PostGreSQL Database and queried to answer our questions.
- Views are created for each answer to aid in quicker recall in the future.

### 4. Visualizing the Data
- Tableau is used to create Visualizations based off our findings

### 5. Developing a Machine Learning Sales Forcast Model

### 6. Presentation to Stakeholders
