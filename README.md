# project-4

Our group aims to look at Walmart store data of 45 Walmarts from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01. Stores have to deal with unforeseen demands or even running out of stock and need a way to ensure they are prepared. We plan to utilize our machine learning knowledge to make these predictions easier! Some questions to look at are:

 What are the weekly sales at each store? And compared to each other?

How do the holidays affect sales? 
And then specifically halloween?

Do fuel prices affect sales?

Does local temperature affect sales?

Unemployment?
